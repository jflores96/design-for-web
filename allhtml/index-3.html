<p class="para">Inside of our brains, in the smallest spaces between neurons, there are synapses. When an action potential is triggered, neurotransmitter is released from one of the axons of a neuron, into the synaptic gap, where it's taken up by receptors on the post-synaptic neuron. When there’s repeated stimulation of a neuronal circuit, <mark>the synaptic chemistry is modified</mark>, and the synaptic junctions are pruned to strengthen that path so it can be activated more readily. Repeated experiences strengthen associations between certain parts of the brain, thus creating long term memory.

<br><mark>The connections in the brain are not indexed and organized in a static format. One neuron can be connected to different places and can be activated by different cues.</mark> When we use language, we activate different parts of the brain. For example, when we say ‘apple’, the parts of our brain associated with memory, language, taste, sight, smell and experience may be activated. The connections function as filters and <mark>other times as amplifiers, through many layers of abstractions.</mark> Observing all this, Catherine Malabou, a neuroscientist and a philosopher, makes this broader point:
